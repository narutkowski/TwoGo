My application is based off of Foursquare, a location-based social network for mobile devices. What my application does is take the places you saved to your todo list on Foursquare and show them in a jquery mobile listview. When a list item is clicked it shows the Name of the place and the address. I could not get the Google Maps API to show a map of the location, but is what I proposed the application to do. I have also proposed the application to get the users current location and only show the places on their todo list that are around their current location. 

  In order to access this application, a user must have a foursquare account already. On the users first visit to the application, they will be asked to login to foursquare and accept the application connection to their foursquare account. The application connects to foursquare via OAuth 2.0.
